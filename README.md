Pulse oximeters are essential medical devices used to monitor a patient's oxygen saturation 
levels, providing critical information about their respiratory function. This report aims to 
evaluate the performance of pulse oximeters in accurately measuring oxygen saturation levels 
and their reliability in clinical settings. The study involved analyzing data from various pulse 
oximeters used in both controlled laboratory conditions and real-world patient monitoring 
scenarios. The primary objectives were to assess the accuracy, precision, and consistency of 
oxygen saturation readings obtained from the devices.
 This presents the design and implementation of a pulse oximeter using the MAX30100 
sensor and ESP8266 microcontroller. The MAX30100 sensor is capable of measuring both red 
and infrared light absorption, which enables the calculation of oxygen saturation levels and heart 
rate. The ESP8266 microcontroller provides the necessary processing power and 
communication capabilities for data acquisition and transmission. Extensive testing and 
validation of the pulse oximeter system are conducted to ensure accurate and reliable 
measurements. The system's performance is evaluated by comparing the obtained results with a 
reference standard pulse oximeter. The evaluation demonstrates the system's capability to 
provide accurate oxygen saturation and heart rate measurements.
